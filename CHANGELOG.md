# Changelog

All notable changes to Adso are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Web UI: edit your **local catalogue fields** inline on a book's page —
  local-only, never synced to Goodreads.
- Conflict decisions now support **ignore** and **review-later** alongside
  keep-local / accept-incoming / custom, and any decision can be **reopened**.
- Every decision is recorded in an append-only audit trail with provenance
  (which interface decided), surfaced in `adso conflicts --all`, the conflict
  report, and the web UI's "Recently decided" section.
- `adso resolve` gains `--ignore`, `--review-later`, and `--reopen`.
- `show` and the CSV/JSON exports now surface the publisher, binding, page count,
  and publication years that were already imported and synced.
- Web UI **Export** page: download the catalogue as CSV or JSON, and run a
  Notion export with a dry-run preview before writing.
- Web UI **report views** (`/reports/summary`, `/reports/conflicts`) and a
  **latest-sync status card** on the Activity page linking to them.
- `exports.catalogue_csv_string` / `catalogue_json_string` (in-memory
  serializers reused by the file exports and the web downloads).

### Changed
- **Local catalogue fields simplified** to `format` (physical / ebook /
  audiobook — set means owned, empty means not owned), `loaned_to`, and
  `local_notes`. The `owned`, `copy_count`, `location`, and `shelf_box` columns
  are dropped from the schema (existing catalogues migrate automatically; any
  values in the dropped columns are discarded). The catalogue's owned/location
  filters, `adso list/search --owned/--location`, and
  `adso edit --owned/--copy-count/--location/--shelf-box` are replaced by
  `--format`, and the Notion export now writes a `Format` select property
  instead of Owned / Location / Shelf-Box.
- `import` and `sync` are now documented as the same safe, idempotent operation,
  and `import` writes a conflict report just like `sync` (previously it could
  record conflicts silently).
- Search now uses a persistent FTS5 index maintained by triggers instead of
  rebuilding the index from scratch on every query.

### Removed
- Dropped the legacy `goodreads_to_notion.py` compatibility shim; use the `adso`
  CLI instead.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-05

First tagged release — a self-hosted technical preview. Clone it, install it, and
run it against your own Goodreads export.

### Added
- Local-first CLI (`adso`) backed by a canonical SQLite catalogue.
- Goodreads CSV import and sync, preserving raw import rows and protecting local
  physical-library fields, with conflict reporting instead of silent overwrites.
- Catalogue commands: `init`, `doctor`, `import`, `sync`, `list`, `search`,
  `show`, `edit`, `conflicts`, `resolve`, `report`, and `export`.
- Exports to CSV and JSON; optional Notion export adapter (`adso export notion`,
  `[notion]` extra) that reads from SQLite as the source of truth.
- Optional local web UI (`adso serve`, `[web]` extra) over the same catalogue,
  including visual conflict resolution, browser import, and an activity view.
- Packaging for self-hosted installs: MIT `LICENSE`, license metadata and a
  PEP 517 build backend in `pyproject.toml`, and a pinned `requirements-lock.txt`
  for reproducible installs.
